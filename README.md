The output of the Solidity code is the creation of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain that defines a simple token with minting and burning capabilities. Below are the key components and their outputs when interacting with the contract:

1. Contract Deployment
When the contract is deployed, it initializes with the specified name and symbol.
2. mint Function
Input: address _to, uint256 _amount
Output: Mints _amount tokens to the _to address. The total supply and the balance of the _to address are increased by _amount.
Event: Emits a Mint event with the recipient address and the amount minted.
3. burn Function
Input: address _from, uint256 _amount
Output: Burns _amount tokens from the _from address. The total supply and the balance of the _from address are decreased by _amount.
Event: Emits a Burn event with the sender address and the amount burned.
4. balanceOf Function
Input: address _address
Output: Returns the token balance of the _address.
5. name Function
Output: Returns the name of the token.
6. symbol Function
Output: Returns the symbol of the token.
7. totalSupply Function
Output: Returns the total number of tokens in existence.
